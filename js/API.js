    The other day <br />
    Your mood was swinging, thought you needed space <br />
    I took a drive and stayed out of the way for you <br />
    But one day turned to three <br />
    Then three into a week <br />
    And I'm starting to think that <br />
    You're somewhere in the middle of the black and the white <br />
    You're growing non-commital, I can see it your eyes <br />
    And I don't know how, and I don't know why <br />
    But my eyes they rain, got a cloudy mind <br />
    Sound the alarm <br />
    The weather man is screaming <br />
    There's a storm <br />
    It's coming, I can feel it <br />
    The trees are barely moving <br />
    And the birds are hardly singing <br />
    The leaves have left the branches <br />
    Now I know you're really leaving <br />
    <br />
    The other day <br />
    I'll admit that I was out of place <br />
    But I just think you went and blew it way out of proportion <br />
    Lost sight of what's important <br />
    You couldn't find a reason to escape, and so you forced it <br />
    You're somewhere in the middle of the black and the white <br />
    You're growing non-commital, I can see it your eyes <br />
    And I don't know how, and I don't know why <br />
    But my eyes they rain, got a cloudy mind <br />
    Sound the alarm <br />
    The weather man is screaming <br />
    There's a storm <br />
    It's coming, I can feel it <br />
    The trees are barely moving <br />
    And the birds are hardly singing <br />
    The leaves have left the branches <br />
    Now I know you're really leaving <br />
    <br />
    Sound the alarm <br />
    The weather man is screaming <br />
    There's a storm <br />
    It's coming, I can feel it <br />
    The trees are barely moving <br />
    And the birds are hardly singing <br />
    The leaves have left the branches <br />
    Now I know you're really leaving <br />
    You're really leaving <br />
    You're leaving <br />

      My thoughts on display <br />
      They're filled with your name <br />
      Close my eyes, will you stay? <br />
      For me <br />
<br />
      Say things, we don't say <br />
      Spilling out our brains <br />
      If we both go insane <br />
      Will we feel the pain? <br />
<br />
      If this was our last day on earth <br />
      I'd spend it with you <br />
      And do all the things we've been too scared to do <br />
      If everything's cursed <br />
      There's nothing to lose <br />
      Let's slow dance in silence while smoke fills the room <br />
      F*** being safe <br />
      Let's make big mistakes <br />
      Drink the night away <br />
      If this was our last day on earth <br />
<br />
      S** under the fire <br />
      We eat till we're tired <br />
      Run where we desire <br />
      Cause we live like <br />
<br />
      We are young <br />
      And life is dumb <br />
      What's the point of living underneath the burning sun? <br />
      We are young <br />

    Water crashing through my mind <br />
    You're so ugly when you cry, baby <br />
    Make a sound and I'll shut you up <br />
    Keeping it rough <br />
    But call it love <br />
<br />
    You've been checking under your bed to see if I'm there <br />
    When you look back up I'm under you pulling your hair <br />
    Getting lost inside my world, you don't know where I've been <br />
    Oh no oh no <br />
    I feel it coming <br />
<br />
    And I tried to save a life <br />
    With these diamond hands of mine <br />
    But they're sharper than a knife <br />
    I am aimed to kill <br />
    And I tried to fix a heart <br />
    With these lips that left some scars <br />
    I swear I won't do no harm <br />
    Shh, I am aimed to kill <br />
<br />
    I am aimed to kill <br />
    I am made to kill <br />
    Love the thrill <br />
    I am aimed to kill <br />
    I am made to kill <br />
    There's a killer on the run <br />
    Someone call 911 <br />
    I am aimed to kill <br />
<br />
    Call me monster or a saint <br />
    I'll still get you either way, baby <br />
    If you scream I will tie you up <br />
    Keeping it rough <br />
    But call it love <br />
<br />
    You've been checking under your bed to see if I'm there <br />

    My soul cannot be found <br />
    I feel it coming <br />
    Don't f***ing tie me down <br />
